# Exercise No. 65

You face 1 out of the 4 compass directions: N, S, E or W.

-   A left turn is a counter-clockwise turn. e.g. N (left-turn) ➞ W.
-   A right turn is a clockwise turn. e.g. N (right-turn) ➞ E.


Create a Python program that takes in a starting direction and a sequence of left and right turns, and outputs the final direction.
