# Exercise No. 18


Create a Python program to sort a list in ascending order which starting from the left of the list and,compare numbers by pairs. If the first pair is ordered [smaller number, larger number], and  so on.

If the first pair is ordered [larger number, smaller number], swap the two integers before moving on to the next pair.

Then repeat this process again until you get to the end of the list.

Then, return to the beginning of the list and repeats this process again until the entire list is sorted.

If the unsorted list is: `[5,100,20,15,150,80,210,30]`, what is the number of swaps you will need?
