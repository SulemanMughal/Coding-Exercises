# Exercise No. 49


Create a class Smoot*hie and do the following: 

-   Create an instance attribute called ingredients. 
-   Create a *get_cost* method which calculates the total cost of the ingredients used to make the smoothie. 
-   Create a *get_price* method which returns the number from calc_cost plus the number from calc_cost multiplied by 1.5. Round to 2 decimal places. 
-   Create a *get_name* method which gets the ingredients and puts them in alphabetical order into a nice descriptive sentence. If there are multiple ingredients, add the word 'Fusion' to the end but otherwise, add 'Smoothie'. Remember to change '-berries to '-berry'. 

**See the examples below.**
